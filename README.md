# TOT Time


**Displays time left to the TNT explosion above primed TNT!**

Modification will work without Fabric API, downloads available!

## Supports 1.21!

Another legacy mod brought to the newest Minecraft release!

## Why Dose this Exist?

This is a fork of [TNT Time Refabricated](https://github.com/shateq/TNTTime), made entirely just to update it to 1.21 for me to use, and I figured I would fork it so others could too. Coming into updating this mod, I had no clue how mods work, and coming out I still have no clue but I did what I needed to do to update the mod.

Two Reasons:
1) I wanted this mod to be updated to use.
2) As a learning experience for me about how to update mods, as this one is pretty simple, I only had to fix 1 line to work with 1.21, and then also all of the random things you need to change the version.

## Will this be updated to future versions?
Maybe, if I am still in need of this mod and I can figure out how to update it to future versions.
